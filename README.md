# 📚 LSTM Character-Level Text Generation

This project demonstrates how to build and train a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network for **character-level text generation** using a classic text corpus. The model learns the sequential structure of text data—specifically, *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*—and generates new, coherent text one character at a time.

This project is a fundamental example of how **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, particularly **LSTM layers**, can model and generate natural language data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Character-Level Learning**: Learns character sequences and predicts the next character in a sequence.
- **Stacked LSTM Architecture**: Uses multiple LSTM layers for deeper sequence understanding.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles cleaning, vocabulary creation, and sequence generation.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatically saves the best model weights during training.
- **Text Generation with Temperature Sampling**: Controls the randomness of output using a tunable `temperature` parameter.
- **Google Colab Ready**: Seamlessly runs in Google Colab with GPU support for faster training.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Downloads the text of *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland* from Project Gutenberg.
  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Converts text to lowercase, removes non-standard characters.
   - Builds a vocabulary and maps characters to integers.

3. **Sequence Creation**  
   - Creates overlapping sequences of a fixed length (e.g., 100 characters).
   - Each sequence is an input and the next character is the target.

4. **Model Architecture**  
   - Built using Keras `Sequential` API:
     - Two LSTM layers with 128 units each
     - Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
     - Dense output layer with `softmax` activation

5. **Training**  
   - Trains on sequences to predict the next character.
   - Uses model checkpointing to save the best weights based on training loss.

6. **Text Generation**  
   - Starts with a seed text.
   - Predicts and appends characters one by one.
   - The `temperature` parameter controls creativity:
     - Low = more predictable
     - High = more creative/random

## 🧪 Example Output

```

Seed: "alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having noth"

Generated:
alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought alice, “without pictures or conversation?”
